# image-carousel
Image carousel build in javascript, SASS and built with Parcel.

Wanted to see if I can make a carousel that only loads the images that are displayed.

You can insert as many images you want to the project, but it only loads 1-2 images at the time.

Number of images is unlimited, it is important to put them in images folder and name them image-1.jpg, image-2.jpg ...etc.
When you press left or right, ther program first checks if it is the first(for left) or last(for right) image and applies a short animation that shows that there are no iamges that way.
If there are images to the left or right, the program then loads the next image, rtund the movement animation and then removes the previous image. Only ever showing the images in the animation.

Hope you enjoy it.

Let me know how I could improve it further.
