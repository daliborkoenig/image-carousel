# image-carousel
Image carousel build in javascript, SASS and built with Parcel.

Wanted to see if I can make a carousel that only loads part of images.

You can insert as many images you want to the project, but it only loads 2-3 images at the time. When you go right it moves and then removes the left most image and loads a new image to the right.
